# Advent of Code 2018

This repository contains my attempts (and hopefully) solutions to Advent of Code 2018 problems.

## Reading Code

If you just want to read code, navigate to `Day X.playground / Pages / Y.xcplaygroundpage / Contents.swift` for each respective day / star.

## Swift Playgrounds and Input Data

I've decided to use Swift Playgrounds with Xcode 10 / Swift 4.2 for the problems this year.

`.playground` files are containers that can hold code and also contain a `Resources` folder that can hold arbitrary files.  Once in the `Resources` folder, those files can be accessed through filesystem APIs in the Playground - which is how I've opted to handle each day's input files.
